Hi!
This is Elysium's frontend new hire test.

Please use Godot to create a simple slot machine. In the "Assets" folder you can find some materials which you can use.

Required features:
1) Spinning slot tiles
2) Show win lines
3) Use bitmap font to show wins
4) WebGL export

Bonus tasks:
1) Implement marsienne twister to generate combinations
2) Pretty winline effects with particles
3) Export under 15mb
4) Accurate RTP
5) Separate backend system which communicates with the frontend via POST/GET
6) Interesting, non standard features and ways to win money (be creative!)
7) Support different languages, loading them separately from the game. Extra bonus points for being able to switch any asset and not just text.
8) Pretty GIT history

There is no time limit. The Bonus Tasks are optional - a good implementation of the base features is much better than having everything done but sloppily.
If you have any questions or doubts, feel free to contact.

Good luck!
